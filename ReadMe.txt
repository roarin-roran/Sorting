sorterManager creats inputs with various levels of presortedness, and will be expanded to add analysis functions

mergeSorter sorts an input using two-way ping-pong merge sort, and will be expanded to add 3/4/k-way merging and run detection.

the mothballed folder contains several old attempts at making the mergeSorter class, retained for reference.
