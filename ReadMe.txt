Interfaces are defined for each substitutable class, currently MergerIPQ and Sorter

one MergerIPQ is currently used - a dummy method that makes no pretense to efficiency

Two sorters are currently used, with an intermediate class defining methods which they both share - PingPong memory
    management

Adaptive sorting takes account of run length, Bottom up does not.

the mothballed folder contains several old attempts at making the mergeSorter class, retained for reference.
